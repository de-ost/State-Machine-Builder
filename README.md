# State Machine Builder

This is a simple state machine builder. It is a simple tool to build a state machine and generate the code for it. The state machine is generated as C-Code and can be used in any C-Project. The state machine is generated as a finite state machine (FSM). The state machine is generated as a deterministic finite state machine (DFSM). To build the state machine, the user has to provide a YAML file. The YAML file contains the definition of the state machine. The YAML file contains the definition of the states, the events, and the transitions. The YAML file contains the definition of the state machine.

## State Machine

A state machine is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite state machines are of two types â€“ deterministic finite state machines and non-deterministic finite state machines. A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.
